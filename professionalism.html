<h1><span class="header-section-number">27</span> Professionalism</h1>
<p>One of the bizarre contradictions of contemporary
capitalism is the label “essential worker.”
As most forms of commerce, business,
production, and exchange shut down to minimize the spread
of the virulent coronavirus, certain sectors of society have
been designated as essential to the skeleton crew keeping a
quarantined society afloat. Incidentally, many of these
“essential workers” turn out to be some of the worst paid and
most precariously employed.
However, rather than, say,
bump up their pay and benefits as befitting of their essential
status within society, capitalists have turned to calling them
heroes.</p>
<p>One clue may be a paper written by sociologist Harold
Wilensky titled “The Professionalization of Everyone?”
published in 1964. Wilensky considered the idea that
eventually, every job would become a profession and every
worker a professional. In the end, he concluded that the idea
of the professionalization of everyone “is a bit of sociological
romance”. However, he did mention, “It may also be
true that the empirical, critical, rational spirit of science finds
its way into an increasing number of occupations” that leads
to “a happy integration of professional and civil culture”.</p>
<p>The world Wilensky lived and worked within
was on the cusp of a fundamental, traumatic transformation,
the consequences of which we now grapple with today.</p>
<p>To understand the origins of professionalism, we need to
understand capitalism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitalists argues that whoever owns the means of
production owns whatever the means of production
produces even if they are not the ones who produces it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our entire society — laws, culture, infrastructure — are designed
around this simple fact. And it is here, in the empty spaces
within the framework of this basic economic relationship
where we will introduce the early professional</p>
<p>Taclott Parsons and Harold Wilensky saw professionals as an outgrowth or
natural conclusion from the development of rationalism,
capitalism, and science. Magali Larson sees professionalism
as an economic strategy where workers in a field get together
and decide to create a mini-monopoly by restricting who gets
to work in it and building prestige around their knowledge
and skills through scarcity. Hannes Siegrist saw
professionalism as a new service class whose clients were
primarily bourgeois and so the professionals imitated the
bourgeois to gain their sympathy and patronage. Others saw
professionals as evolving from medieval guilds, using scarcity
to justify insulation from the constant shocks of the free
market. But one thing was certain, professionals didn’t
exactly fit into the neat picture of capitalism as the owners of
production (the bourgeois) or the laborers whose work is
exploited for profit (the proletariat).</p>
<p>There are some agreed
upon traits found among most of the original professions
(generally considered medicine and law, sometimes military,
teaching, clergy, and engineering). They include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>an esoteric body of knowledge that professionals claimed
mastery over</li>
<li>some form of occupational enclosure (restricted access to
being a member of the profession)3. some formalized or institutionalized process that
regulated membership within the profession (usually
through credentials and education)</li>
<li>a camaraderie or collegiality among peers recognized as
fellow professionals</li>
<li>autonomy as a worker (generally self-employed) and
autonomy as a field to self-regulate itself</li>
<li>A service-oriented ethic, usually one that asserts the
profession serves a higher societal good above mere
commerce which often leads to the profession developing
a sense of purpose beyond profit</li>
</ol>
<p>Already, there’s some characteristics about professionals that
seem anti-capitalist. For one, there’s the idea of occupational
enclosure; the concept of a free and unregulated market is
anathema to the idea of a monopoly or oligopoly, and
professions were essentially that.</p>
<p>Most professions allied with
the newly formed and growing nation-states of the 1700s and
1800s, relying on the state to regulate their markets through
legal systems that made it illegal to practice without some
kind of license or degree.</p>
<p>The collective identity of
professionals belonging to a single profession (and often
creating powerful organizations and interest groups to
protect and promote their agendas) also flies in the face of
capitalist ideas of self-interest, enlightened greed, and
individualism.</p>
<p>There is an idea that professionals work for a higher calling
than profit.</p>
<p>** Unions vs Professions**: As capitalism and labor markets grew more complex and workers became more aware of their exploited status, there were two options a workforce could essentially take in the 1800s-1900s: they could either unionize or professionalize. Unions and professions basically had the same goals — create regulations that would bring more profit to their work — but allied with different agendas. Unions veered towards a proletariat identity while professionals veered towards a bourgeois identity. You can see this in how they celebrate themselves and how they’re perceived in society. Unions emphasize the trades and craftsmanship, solidarity amongst the working class regardless of occupation and organizing against the owners of the means of production. Professions emphasize their skill but through mastery of knowledge and education, their status as individual experts rather than a collective group, and internalizing bourgeois values of apolitical neutrality, a disdain for conflict, and Victorian ideas of discretion and comportment.</p>
<p>And then <strong>neoliberalism</strong> happened. During the 1970s, a series
of economic crises such as stagflation and recessions and oil
price spikes disrupted the capitalist dream. With the ever-
looming threat of communism, capitalists began to push for a
more aggressive, even more distilled version of capitalism. If
the post-Great Depression era was leaders like Franklin
Delano Roosevelt saving capitalism from itself by making it
softer and kinder (to an extent), then the new neoliberal
capitalists saw the answer in pushing capitalism to its limits.
Because of their belief in the invisible hand and virtuous self-
interest, they sought to make everything in society governed
by the free market. This often meant drastic deregulation and
the elimination of any kind of government-run program or
centralized structures and institutions. It meant subjecting
everyone to the full whims of the market, with all of its
booms and busts, believing that the it would sort out the
winners and the losers and that both of them would be
deserving of their respective fates.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most pervasive (and perverse) effects of
neoliberalism, however, is how it changed the very concept of
the self. Because neoliberals worshipped capital, they also
believed people should act like capital itself — fluid, easilytransformed, fungible, mobile, infinitely transmutable, and
self-generating in profits. We should be entrepreneurs, not
workers.</p>
<p>Neoliberalism rooted the
means of production in the individual. It (falsely) redefined
the means of production as labor, and everyone could provide
some kind of labor.
Everyone was redefined as a
capitalist. It was all a slight of hand to get us to look away
from the actual structural problems of capitalism and focus
on the individual instead.
<em>Neoliberals did not like professions at all</em>.</p>
<p>Capitalists broke up unions much more aggressively and
violently; to break the power-base of professionals, who were
often wealthier and held more status and power, more subtle
strategies were necessary.</p>
<p>Capitalism began to
purposefully exploit that labor more and more by “de-
skilling” certain types of work and then using the excuse that
a once valued skilled work is now unskilled.
As women and people of color entered the professions,
those who paid the professionals used it as an excuse to
denigrate professional work and thus professional pay.
This not
only changed the nature of work but the nature of the
worker: “people bend towards an adaptable/sacrificial
/oblative position.</p>
<p><strong>Precarization:</strong> governing a population through creating
precarity.
<em>Neoliberalism, by leaning hard into capitalism’s roots,
rebranded precarity as freedom</em>:
Convince people that precarity was self-
empowering.</p>
<p>Thus, the <em>gig economy</em> isn’t exploiting workers by giving
them unstable, hard-to-predict-or-plan-for working hours; it’s
giving them the freedom to work whenever they wanted.</p>
<p>Precarity, isn’t something to insulate yourself from; it is a
virtue to embrace. Precarity means freedom and
empowerment.</p>
<p>As labor became more fluid and decentralized, it became
more profitable and easier to exploit but also made it harder
for employers to control.
But then neoliberals figured something out. What does this
new worker sound like? Someone who works autonomously
and individually as opposed to in a collective or corporate
group setting, someone who has to self-regulate themselves,
who sees their economic value in their diverse set of skills
rather than what they directly produce or own, and often
wants a higher purpose in their work outside of just getting
enough money to survive?
Oh.
They sound like professionals,
suddenly, the professional, that oddball of capitalism,
found the perfect slot to fit into in neoliberalism.</p>
<p>Professionalism was a
ready-made, already existing pool of ideas and beliefs and
aspirations and emotions that employers could tap into to
control the increasing margin of indeterminacy or flexibility in work.
It turns your
work into your identity, and you into your work.
To put it
more bluntly, you didn’t have to obsessively watch over your
employees anymore if you could get your employees to do it
for you by surveilling themselves.</p>
<p>And so, we have all for the most part
accepted the idea that we must all act like professionals even
if we enjoy the complete opposites of the privileges
professionals traditionally enjoyed. And, perhaps most
chilling of all, most of us want to be a professional, desire to
be professional, and judge those who are not, regardless of
whether we’re treated as such.</p>
<p>The phrase: “socially essential.” Paramedics,
ambulance drivers, grocery store clerks, truck drivers,
cleaning staff, cooks — all of these jobs are “socially
essential” but aren’t treated or paid as such.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be professional is to be
self-sacrificing, and if there’s one thing capitalists and the
bourgeois middle class love to do, it’s sacrificing others for
themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do we pay the most worthless of our society the most and the most valuable members of our society the least?
Because we’re all professionals now. And professionals are not supposed to be in it for the money but for the love of the game.
Except we didn’t make the rules for the game.
The capitalists did.</p>
