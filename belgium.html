<p>Across the Channel, Belgium was the second country after Britain to undergo a precocious industrial revolution. The process was partly driven by capital transfers from the English North: the Lancashire blacksmith and toolmaker William Cockerill arrived in LiÃ¨ge in 1799, when the Southern Low Countriesâ€”formerly a Habsburg possessionâ€”had been annexed to the French Republic under Napoleonâ€™s forces. Cockerill found the social pre-conditions for mechanizing the Verviers woollen-handicraft industry not so different from those at home. His son John Cockerill expanded the familyâ€™s machine-building firm into a massive ironworks in the Seraing basin, turning the small post-Napoleonic buffer state into a global leader in steel production.</p>
<p>As de Gaulle later quipped, the Kingdom of Belgium was always a country â€˜created by the British to annoy the Frenchâ€™. In 1815 the (largely Catholic) Southern Low Countries had been gifted to the (Protestant) Dutch monarch by the Congress of Vienna, but Brabant radicals rose against Dutch rule in 1830, with the tacit backing of the clergy and landowning nobility. In the heat of the 1830 revolt, Palmerstonâ€™s Cabinet engineered the new state as a perfect replica of the Westminster model, installing as its first king the uncle of the future Queen Victoria. The Belgian ruling bloc equally united a wealthy aristocratic landowning class with rising industrial strata, tightly knit around an arriviste royal house, and soon strutting an empire in the Congo built on raw-resource extraction. The family resemblance was remarkableâ€”although Belgian elites, inured against external absolutist rule, always tolerated a higher degree of provincial and municipal autonomy. As Marx remarked, Belgium was â€˜the snug, well-hedged, little paradise of the landlord, the capitalist and the priestâ€™.</p>
<p>The development of 19th-century Belgian capitalism also offered, in microcosm, a parallel to the deep regional divisions of its larger overseas neighbour. Western Europeâ€™s bourgeois enclave was linguistically divided between a poor agrarian Dutch-speaking northâ€”the province of Flanders, with its North Sea estuary port at Antwerpâ€”and the industrializing, mainly Francophone, southern province of Wallonia, oriented south and east towards France and Germany. Like the English North, the Belgian South developed into a smokestack landscape of steel mills, textile factories and mines, the â€˜industrial furrowâ€™ of the Sambreâ€“Meuse valley, running from the Borinage coalfields to Charleroi, LiÃ¨ge and Verviers. Meanwhile the large agricultural hinterland of Flanders, populated by peasant families and putting-out households, was the equivalent of Britainâ€™s internal Irish colony. In the 1840s, overtaken by a potato famine of Irish proportions, and as domestic weaving collapsed in face of international competition, the Flemish countryside discharged hundreds of thousands of impoverished cottagers into Wallonian mines and mills. There, their immigrant children quickly grew Francophone, shedding Dutch-speaking roots. As late as 1904, Rosa Luxemburg could speak of Flemish workers as â€˜also dispossessed of their languageâ€™.</p>
<p>Walloniaâ€™s industrial capital was never locally sourced. Instead, it was sponsored by financiers and landowners from splendid villas in Francophone Brussels, operating through holding companies structured by giant investment banks. An administrative centre under the Habsburgs, well-staffed with lawyers and bankers, Brussels was, like London, an essentially cosmopolitan city, its gaze always directed outward, and embedded in international capital flows that made it more beholden to foreign debtors than to workers in its own hinterland. These qualities also made French-speaking Brussels an essential FremdkÃ¶rper, situated within a Dutch-speaking North, overseeing a rapidly industrializing South, each either territorially or linguistically distinct from the Belgian capital. Capitalist development only deepened this outsider status. Far more than London, Brussels would be characterized by the absence of manufacturing, and consequently of an urban proletariat. Instead, as noted by the Flemish-nationalist historian Antoon Roosens, a high concentration of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois consumers made the capital â€˜by far the most important market in the country for all finished industrial products.â€™ This â€˜abnormal social compositionâ€™ also explained the cityâ€™s persistent provincialism, populated by citizens who had â€˜made bourgeois mimesis their very mode of thinking and living.â€™footnote26 More an administrative centre than a megacity, Brussels lacked the â€˜red beltsâ€™ which gave suburban Paris and London their municipal radicals (even if Marx penned the Communist Manifesto here in 1847).</p>
<p>As with Britain, the head-start provided by Belgiumâ€™s early industrialization had turned into a disadvantage by the 1900s. Like Englandâ€™s North, Wallonia was overtaken by the rise of more dynamic manufacturing centres in the Ruhr and beyond. After 1914, Belgian decline accelerated precipitously: World War One brought devastation, deepened by the Depression and Nazi occupation. In the post-war era, Belgiumâ€™s position was weaker still than Britainâ€™s, with a much smaller and more exposed domestic market. At this point, however, the trajectories of the two economies divergedâ€”with important consequences for their regional outcomes. A number of factors were involved. First, while post-war British leaders struggled to maintain the ukâ€™s world-imperial privilege, Belgiumâ€™s political elites were ready for a new start. Threatened by international competition, they recognized a small economy at the centre of Europe could only survive as an open transit point for neighbouring economies. Churchill and Eden were happy to watch European integration from afar, priding themselves on the special relationship with Washington. With this imperial hangover, Britain never produced an equivalent to Paul-Henri Spaak, who played a central role in drafting the Treaty of Rome and succeeded in getting both the eec and nato headquartered in Brussels. Unlike de Gaulle, Spaak took care to hitch his countryâ€™s wagon to European integration without angering the American allies, making clear that Belgium would never plan to build a rival pole to Washington; quite the contrary.footnote27 Europeanization and internal modernization then went hand in hand.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Flemish region reaped the primary fruits of this modernizing strategy. A Ten-Year Plan re-tooled the port of Antwerp to meet the needs of American multinationals. It soon transcended mere transit status, providing a penumbra of assembly plants and light-industrial complexes around the docks to finish and repackage us goods for inland destinations. At the same time, relying on its maritime pivot, Flemish policy makers were able to turn the region into an export power for an eager German neighbour. Unlike its Irish counterpart, Flanders did not rest content as a simple safe haven for offshore capital. Instead, the Flemish elite began an ambitious drive towards a West-European knowledge economy, preparing an under-educated workforce for the era of high-value-added production. Petrochemical industries were propped up by a state-led university system, joined by world-class research clusters in bioengineering and medical sciences.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, the Anglo-Belgian divergence was becoming plain to see. Between 1950 and 1985, Belgiumâ€™s growth rates were 50 per cent higher than the ukâ€™s, driven mainly by modern light-industrial development around Antwerp, assisted by the regulatory machine in Brussels. When uk growth rates did recover, from 1985 to 2008, the expansion was concentrated in the Southeast, driven by crisis-prone financial expansion and asset-price inflation. Here lay another contrast: the role played by London in Englandâ€™s Northâ€“South divide had no parallel in Belgium. First, Brussels has never been an organic part of either region; it is seen from Wallonia as a citadel of industrial exploiters, while for Flanders it is a mere â€˜oil stainâ€™ of francophonie. In this sense, Belgium could never be Brussellized, in the way that the uk had Londonized. On the contrary, Brussels had to watch the growth of its rival, Antwerp, as a multinational business centre, while it became mainly a supplier of regulatory services, helping American companies navigate the eec. Second, while the City of London expanded relentlessly on the basis of Eurodollar trading, the post-war retreat of Belgiumâ€™s old holding bourgeoisie demoted Brussels as a financial hub. Unlike the uk, Belgium was able to shuffle a redundant rentier class off-stage and kickstart a new developmental trajectory.</p>
<p>And Wallonia? In 1960â€“61, galvanized by a massive strike wave, support grew for a regionalist breakaway movement as proposed by the charismatic metalworkersâ€™ leader AndrÃ© Renard. Flemish support for the return of the Nazi-collaborationist King Leopold iii in 1950, bitterly opposed in Wallonia, helped to cast the Flemish North as a drag on the Southâ€™s socialist ambitions. Rather than accept Flemish cohabitation in a house tended by Belgiumâ€™s bourgeoisie, Walloniaâ€™s proletariat should contemplate a proper jailbreak. The escape was to be both economic and political: autonomy for the countryâ€™s two linguistic communities, and a socialization of industry in the South. Although never a majority force in the Parti Socialiste (ps), Renardists assembled a lively cohort for socialism in one region.</p>
<p>Before too long, howeverâ€”compounding the shock loss of the Congo in 1960â€”Europeâ€™s oldest steel sector was hit by the consequences of global overcapacity. Suddenly, there was no industry left to nationalize. By the early 1970s, Renardâ€™s followers were left with a desiccated industrial landscape, only meagrely irrigated by state coffers. Meanwhile, in 1968 Flemish students had followed their Parisian counterparts by demanding an end to the Francophone dominance at the countryâ€™s oldest academic institution, the Catholic University of Leuven. Regionalization was now continuing at cruising speed, but hardly to the Southâ€™s benefit. Instead, LiÃ¨ge and Charleroi became the ruined temples of Belgian manufacturing, Manchesters without the sea, Pittsburghs on the Meuse.</p>
<p>These developments gave the final push to a tottering Belgique Ã  papa.footnote28 From 1970 onwards, Belgiumâ€™s old guard relaxed its grip on the unitary state as it initiated a series of reforms to regionalize and de-centralize the political system. Three official language communities, Dutch (59.6 per cent), French (40 per cent) and German (0.4 per cent), were established through the talentelling (language count); they would eventually acquire a council each, charged with education. Three political regionsâ€”the Brussels Capital Region, Flanders and Walloniaâ€”were also given their own parliaments. An intricate system of financial transfers was set in placeâ€”disparagingly known as centenfederalisme, or â€˜cash federalismâ€™, by Flemish nationalistsâ€”through which regions and communities would receive the bulk of their budgets from the central government. Step by step, in the 1980s, 90s and 2000s, new institutions began to operate and the Constitution was amended to define Belgium as â€˜a federal state composed of communities and regionsâ€™.</p>
<p>Walloniaâ€™s leaders decided to swim with the tide. During the crisis years of the 1970s, they picked at the carcass of the unitary state and secured emergency funding for Wallonia. It was clear that the centre of gravity of the Belgian economy had shifted dramatically northward: two economic polesâ€”the port delta around Antwerp and a Brussellian metropole welcoming lobbyists into a growing eu bureaucracyâ€”had replaced the Southâ€™s industrial magnets. The shift left behind a self-determining Wallonia that now had little to determine for itself. Subsequent generations of Walloon Socialists vacillated between performative unionism in government, to assure revenue for their region, and an assertive regionalism when stuck in opposition.footnote29 The Flemish bias towards export strategies, coupled with the Northâ€™s voting power, further marginalized the Renardist tendency. In the 1980s, the Walloon Socialist leader AndrÃ© Cools tried to counter regional decline by promoting municipal sharing schemes known as intercommunales: local councils could jointly manage public services and safeguard the countryâ€™s welfare gains.footnote30</p>
<p>Here was a further difference between Walloniaâ€™s post-industrial status and that of Englandâ€™s North. Compared to Thatcherâ€™s onslaught, the neoliberal medicine administered by her Belgian admirer Wilfried Martens was relatively mild. The Catholic Party leader was partly checked by the stiff opposition of the Christian-Democrat trade-union wing. Federalism certainly helped to cushion the blow, albeit more through a Hegelian cunning of unreason: Belgiumâ€™s byzantine set-up has given Francophone Socialists veto power over a neoliberal push from the export-oriented North, despite the latterâ€™s greater voting strength. With conservatives permanently unable to gain a unicameral majority Ã  la Thatcher, it has been much easier to maintain Belgiumâ€™s corporatist structuresâ€”union control of social-security finances, enforced social bargaining, wage indexation, generous insurance mechanisms. In a small country with a relatively well-organized working classâ€”in 2019, union membership surpassed 50 per centâ€”Thatcherâ€™s Blitzkrieg on the miners never was a practical possibility. Unlike Italy or France, Belgian elites were also less eager to instrumentalize the eu to implement capitalist policy by stealth. That option required a greater degree of elite closure anyway, something Belgiumâ€™s fractious ruling bloc could never muster.</p>
<p>Flanders became the luckiest legatee of Belgiumâ€™s regional partition. Fusing the institutions of the Flemish â€˜communityâ€™ with those of the Flanders â€˜regionâ€™, it achieved full parliamentary devolution in 1995. For the Flemings, the Belgian house has been uitgeleefdâ€”out-lived, or perhaps out-grown. As with any separatist squabble, the â€˜transfer debateâ€™ remains rife with acrimony; in 2005, Flemish nationalists drove a lorry full of fake euro bills to the south of their language border. The man who performed this stunt, Bart De Wever, is now Mayor of Antwerp. He has become only slightly less histrionic in his advocacy for the cityâ€™s export interests. No regionally unified Flemish capitalist class has cohered around this transitionâ€”yet.footnote31 Both the port of Antwerp and the Brussels metropolitan region are domains where foreign companies call the shots, â€˜facilitatedâ€™ by Flemish and local authorities. Attempts to grant a Flemish-separatist project real political-economic depth remain breathless at best, mostly ruses to normalize the regionâ€™s far right. Nevertheless, visions of a regionally anchored neoliberalism have enjoyed a resurgence since 2010 with the rise of the free-market n-va (Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie, or New Flemish Alliance), currently the dominant party in Flandersâ€”and led by the same Bart De Wever. Opting for a gradualist lineâ€”first confederalism, then full independenceâ€”the n-va is without doubt the most vocal of all separatist formations. The other contender, Vlaams Belang, has always stuck to a more chauvinist line, preferring to save money by keeping the foreigners out.</p>
<p>English Northerners undoubtedly have reasons to be envious of their Walloon cousins. Though companions of the same post-industrial fate, Belgian deindustrialization has treated its working classes more fairly and less punitively. Walloon clientelism has proved less financialized, with social housing keeping up a steady pace of growth, in contrast to the council-housing sell-offs granted by Thatcher to the Northâ€™s ex-factory workersâ€”said by some to be a key indicator of the Brexit vote. Contemporary Belgium is certainly no corporatist Eden, untouched by the market turn. But it has resisted many of the trends that have scarred countries in the developed world and boasts a better Gini-coefficient than other early industrializers.</p>
<p>Anglo-Belgian divergences should not be overstated, however. Regionalization has hardly been a benediction to Belgiumâ€™s South. While Britain has six of the ten poorest regions in Northwest Europe, the Walloon regions of Hainaut, LiÃ¨ge and Charleroi are little better off. And just as South Yorkshire is only a few hours from inner Londonâ€”still Europeâ€™s richest districtâ€”so LiÃ¨ge also lies conspicuously closely to Luxembourg. Federalization has helped Wallonia, but it has hardly saved it. The cinema of the Dardenne brothers, with its focus on â€˜povertyâ€™ rather than class, provides aesthetic backing for a ps project of federally funded regional poverty management for the South that has given up hopes of reindustrialization altogether. The Dardennesâ€™ oeuvre, from Rosetta to Two Days, One Night and The Unknown Girl, makes a striking contrast to the class confrontations depicted in the electrifying 1934 documentary MisÃ¨re au Borinage by Henri Storck and Joris Ivens.</p>
<p>Flemish neoliberals remain hopeful about a separatist free-trade breakthrough, letting the â€˜best student in the Belgian classâ€™ flourish next to competitors in Poland or Latvia. To no avail, however: anno 2021, the Belgian state is still here, badly mismanaging the covid crisis. But managing, nonetheless. It has to be said that the regional response to covid was just as shambolic as the federal one. Beneath Belgiumâ€™s so-called â€˜communitarianâ€™ crisis smoulders not only a medical or logistical crisis but above all a political one, affecting Belgiumâ€™s party democracy at its core. Recently leaked memos of the 2019 governmental negotiations indicated Francophone Socialistsâ€™ willingness to split between regions not only social security, but also labour-market policy and fire services. Hoping to secure its baronies in Brussels with a final pay out, the ps appeared willing to trade in the national achievements of the Belgian labour movement.</p>
<p>Some tough questions follow. As the Walloon example shows, behind the question of regionalization stands the more intimidating one of capital investment. The English North never acquired a form of proto-statehood that would allow it to practice a properly local developmentalism; it was forced instead into an amorphous form of rebellion, within a topsy-turvy electoral geography that never provided a platform for regional consciousness. A look at post-industrial regions that did gain this form of statehood, however, is not comforting. In 2016, Walloon prime minister and Socialist Party leader Paul Magnette garnered laurels from the European left for his rebellion in the federal parliament against the imposition of the neoliberalizing euâ€“Canada trade deal. This act of resistance hid a structural dependency of the Walloon region on Flemish transfers, which have grown precipitously in the wake of federalization. Behind this lies the secular decline of Wallonian industry, unable to profit from containerization and shut out from the German-led Central European export boom.</p>
